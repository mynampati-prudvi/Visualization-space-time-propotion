Great News! Based on your business plan/proposal, the ministry of power in conjunction with a consortium of private equity firms has awarded you and your firm a multi-year contract to help them design a data driven approach to help the country fulfill its energy capacity, meet its energy demand, and create a sustainable, and potentially clean, source of energy for future growth.



• Using the business problem, you formulated, and working with the same data portal, build visualizations that helps the minster of energy understand the timeline of energy use in India’s various states.


• Help the minster understand the proportion of energy(choose electricity, coal, gas, and oil) use based on industry. Which industries are more likely to champion a different energy source? This will be used for her upcoming presentation to the prime minster, and to award firms public policy contracts in the affected areas.


• Map out energy use by state and show a comparison of areas with high/low energy consumption based on industries operating in those countries.
